# Assisted Teleoperation with Augmented Reality [![Build Status]

JUST STARTED WRITING THE README. LOTS TO BE WRITTEN SOON!

This repository contains the soiurce code for the ATAR package. This package can be used to design interactive augmented reality (or virtual reality) tasks using a stereo camera, master and slave manipulators. I have developed and tested this on a da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK) that comprises 5 manipulators (2 masters, 2 slaves and a camera arm), a stereo endoscope and stereo vision console. Tha package includes the code for the calibrations involved (Camera intrinsics, extrinsics, and arm to world) and a qt graphical user interface. THe simulated world includes rigid and soft dynamics simulation based on the Bullet Physics library and graphics are generated using the Visualization toolkit (VTK) and OpenGL.

## Requirements
This package needs the following libraries/packages.
